# The Lixious

The Lixious is a fully intuitive gaming app with extremely didactic sounds and images to help you achieve the ultimate goal: recycling responsibly and saving our planet Earth!

## How to Play

The game involves separating the waste into their corresponding bins as they fall on the screen, before they fall into the wrong bin. The aim is to accumulate points and avoid losing lives. The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses through the levels, with the waste falling faster and faster.


## Installation

The Lixious can be downloaded for free from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jr.thelixious).
